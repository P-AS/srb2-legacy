This folder contains the files that will be packaged with the built APK.

  These files are not required to be bundled with the application package:

    * srb2.pk3
    * zones.pk3
    * player.dta
    * patch.pk3 (if it exists)

  NOTE: If they are missing, the app will look for them inside the following
  path, under either internal storage or external storage:

    /Android/data/org.stjr.srb2/files/

  These files MUST be bundled with the application package:

    * android.pk3
    * splash.png

  These files are completely optional, regardless of being inside the built
  package or not, and the app may launch without their presence:

    * music.dta
    * patch_music.pk3 (if it exists)
